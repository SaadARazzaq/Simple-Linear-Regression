# Simple-Linear-Regression

This repository contains a Python program for implementing simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X).

## Requirements

To run the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` or any package manager of your choice.
3. Place the dataset `data_1d.csv` in CSV format inside the repository directory or update the file path in the code accordingly.
4. Run the `simple_linear_regression.py` file to execute the program.

The program reads the dataset, calculates the regression coefficients (slope and intercept), and plots the data points along with the regression line.

## Dataset

The program expects a dataset in CSV format. Ensure that the dataset has two columns: 'X' and 'Y'. You can provide your own dataset or use the provided sample dataset 'data_1d.csv' for testing.

The repository also includes handwritten notes screenshots (found in the `Simple Linear Regression.ipynb`) that provide mathematical calculations used for the model.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it to suit your needs, and use it as a foundation for further analysis or projects involving simple linear regression.ðŸ˜Š
